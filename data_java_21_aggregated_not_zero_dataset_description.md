## Dataset Description
The dataset contained detailed information about each student enrolled in the mi-cro-learning course on programming in Java. The course contained more than 400 mi-cro-learning units divided into thematic topics. Each topic provided several categories of units, like an explanation of the theory, quizzes, and programming assignments with automated programming code evaluation. The students could repeatedly use these units and train in practical programming skills. The students received the fol-lowing two types of grades:
* Grades, which characterize the level of comprehension of the learning content belonging to the individual topics of the course. The platform collected data about the number of quizzes attempted, scores received, and time spent, which was summarized in these grades.
* Grades from automatically evaluated programming assignments using a modified VPL. The platform collected data about the number of attempts, received scores, using hints, and spent time which participated in the calculation of these grades. 

The attributes of the input dataset correspond to the individual topics, which the students learnt during the term. 
* intro,	intro-VPL	- Introduction to the programming language Java
* methods,	methods-VPL - Methods
* encap,	encap-VPL - Encapsulation
* constructors, constructors-VPL	- Contructors
* classes1,	classes1-VPL - Object-oriented paradigm - Classes
* classes2,	classes2-VPL	- Object-oriented paradigm - Classes
* static,	static-VPL	- Static classes
* inher	inher-VPL - Inheritence 
* polymorphism,	polymorphism-VPL - Polymorphism	
* methods-VPL-f,	encap-VPL-f,	constructors-VPL-f,	classes2-VPL-f,	static-VPL-f,	inher-VPL-f,	polymorphism-VPL-f,	sum_vpl - other attributes, which were omitted in the study. They represented total and sub-totals, which helped the teachers to calculate final grades.
